<p><strong>Elizabeth Anne Holland is a 21-year-old model from Hull.</strong></p> <p>She <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3358064/Young-size-8-model-told-shrink-reveals-left-feeling-depressed-suicidal-chasing-dream.html">began modelling</a> at the age of 16 and was later scouted by a ‘big’ agency who promised her world travel and high-class jobs. The model took to Facebook recently to expose the ridiculous pressures of the industry and expose its negativity.</p> <p>Elizabeth writes about the moment she met with the agency, which she has not named. She says:</p> <p>“They told me my hip measurements were too big and I needed to shrink all over. I'm 5'9 nearly 5'10 size 8... And they wanted me to be smaller? Unfortunately, I fell for it, I've been one of those girls who are told they are not thin enough. Not good enough”.</p> <p>She went on to explain that her involvement with the agency led her to feel low, lose her confidence and enter into an unhealthy relationship with food and her body image.</p> <blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="6"> <div style="padding: 8px;"> <div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 59.8692810458% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"></div> <p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_B_EYLM-T8/" target="_blank">A photo posted by Elizabeth Anne Holland (@eliizabeth.anne)</a> on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2015-12-08T12:35:11+00:00">Dec 8, 2015 at 4:35am PST</time></p> </div> </blockquote> <p><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer="defer"></script>She decided to speak out now because she has just been spotted by another agency and once again has been told her measurements are too big. Elizabeth explains:</p> <p>“The fact is, I get reeled in, made to feel good, but then smacked right down again. It's like you wanna prove you're good enough but know you're not. There is a massive battle in my head going on because of this and it's really hard to cope with.” The model continues saying, “It's literally soul destroying. I never used to have a problem with my confidence and appearance, whereas now I almost couldn't dislike myself more. I see the fat, because of them. I see how gross my face is and my wonky tooth is because of them”.</p> <p>Elizabeth concludes the post by encouraging girls to share what she has said in the hope that she can expose the truth of the fashion industry. </p> <div id="fb-root"></div> <p><script>// <![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]></script></p> <div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/elizabeth.holland.1/posts/921366354625100" data-width="500"> <div class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"> <blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/elizabeth.holland.1/posts/921366354625100"><p>Hey!
