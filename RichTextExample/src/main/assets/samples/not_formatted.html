After a tense Congress, Daniel White of Connecticut was elected as Uachtarain Cumann Luthcleas Gael for the next three years, on a platform of jazzing up the Presidency role. Here is the 10 point plan he intends to adhere to as GAA President. <h4><strong>1. Instead of remaining aloof, he will instead tweet his opinion during matches...</strong></h4> <a href="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14110539/dana.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-300939 aligncenter" src="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14110539/dana.png" alt="dana" width="573" height="281" /></a> <h4><strong>2. Personally break up mass brawls in the tunnel</strong></h4> <a href="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14110721/donetyro.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-300940 aligncenter" src="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14110721/donetyro.png" alt="donetyro" width="702" height="384" /></a> <h4><strong>3. Instead of sanctioning the Dubs playing in Croke Park all the time, he would constantly toy with the idea of them playing there but ultimately send them to Las Vegas</strong></h4> <h4><strong><a href="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14110810/crokepark.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-300941 aligncenter" src="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14110810/crokepark.jpg" alt="crokepark" width="540" height="359" /></a>  </strong></h4> <h4><strong>4. Personally challenge Gaelic footballers who criticise the GAA hierarchy to a game of one-on-one Gaelic football</strong></h4> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIi3ZEvxKww" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe> <h4><strong>5. Invite the Man of the Match in the All-Ireland final for a spin in his vehicle </strong></h4> Protocall would dictate that the recipient of this victory spin tweet a picture of himself in an Uachtarain's Ferrari. <h4><strong>6. He'd host a pre-match press conference, shamelessly sucking up to the fans in whatever county he is in at the time</strong></h4> <a href="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14112604/dana.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-300946 aligncenter" src="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14112604/dana.jpg" alt="dana" width="540" height="362" /></a> <h4><strong>7. Will forsake his suit, and instead wear either O'Neill's or Azzuri gear at official engagements </strong></h4> Will lead a product placement revolution within the association <h4><strong>8. He will discontinue to practise of standing resolutely behind a referee after a contentious decision. He will pile on like everyone else  </strong></h4> <a href="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14112024/sludds.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-300944 aligncenter" src="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14112024/sludds.jpg" alt="sludds" width="540" height="363" /></a> <h4><strong>9. He will become a co-presenter of the Sunday Game with Michael Lyster</strong></h4> RTE will be forced to move to the double-presenter model with the Prez and Michael Lyster joshing back and forth before bringing Joe Brolly in. <h4><strong>10. He will discard careful, official Ireland speak </strong></h4> Before presenting the Cup to the winning captain, he will ask the crowd to join with him in expressing their appreciation for that 'fuckin amazing game' <a href="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14112232/liam.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-300945 aligncenter" src="http://media.balls.ie/uploads/2015/07/14112232/liam.jpg" alt="liam" width="540" height="420" /></a> <h4></h4> &nbsp; <iframe src="//renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/55a3772758c2369b0eb04a93" width="100%" height="458" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
