</p> <p>It has been 10 years since the events of Terminator. Sarah Connor’s ordeal is only just
    beginning as she struggles to protect her son John, the future leader of the human resistance
    against the machines, from a new Terminator, sent back in time to eliminate John Connor while
    he’s still a child. Sarah and John don’t have to face this terrifying threat alone however. The
    human resistance have managed to send them an ally, a warrior from the future ordered to protect
    John Connor at any cost.</p> <p>The battle for tomorrow has begun…</p> <p><strong>The
    restoration:</strong></p> <p>The original 35mm negative was scanned and then restored in 4k at
    Deluxe L.A., under the supervision of Geoff Burdick from Lightstorm. The film was calibrated in
    4k by Skip, James Cameron’s colorist, at Technicolor Hollywood, with a selection of the best
    35mm prints from the film&#8217;s first release. The film was then converted into 3D by Stereo D
    (<em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, <em>Jurassic world</em>).</p> <p><img

        sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px"/>This work lasted almost a year and was monitored
    daily by Lightstorm&#8217;s teams, to produce a high-end 3D version at the level of the latest
    3D releases from U.S. Studios. The 3D version then benefited from a calibration and a specific
    finish at Technicolor Hollywood, still under the supervision of Skip and James Cameron himself.
</p> <p>The restoration project was initiated by Lightstorm, James Cameron’s production company, DMG
    Entertainment and STUDIOCANAL. James Cameron&#8217;s team oversaw this 3D conversion from start
    to finish. This highly experienced and award-winning team had already supervised
    <em>Titanic</em>&#8216;s 3D conversion and is currently working on the <em>Avatar</em> sequels.
