<blockquote><p>I never read the papers. I make a policy of keeping a clear mind.</p></blockquote> <p>That was what Joe Brolly said when asked on <a href="http://www.rte.ie/radio/radioplayer/rteradiowebpage.html#!rii=1%3A20828809%3A5777%3A12%2D08%2D2015%3A">2FM's Game On</a> if he had read <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/darragh-%C3%B3-s%C3%A9-mayo-must-make-the-most-of-aidan-o-shea-1.2313845">Darragh Ó Sé's column in Wednesday's Irish Times</a>. Presumably, as someone employed by a newspaper (the Sunday Indo), he would prefer if others did not adopt that same ideology in their lives.</p> <p>Ó Sé argued that what the Derryman most desires is a good argument. It's one of his base needs and if he has to contradict himself from time to time to make a particular case then Ó Sé believes that Brolly is willing to bend his principles.</p> <p>The former Kerry midfielder encapsulated Brolly's combative tongue by hypothesising a meeting between the RTÉ analyst and the Dalai Lama. 30 minutes in a room with Brolly would negate the 'bould Dalai's' zen nature according to Ó Sé and result in a broken nose for Joe.</p> <p>As Brolly had not read the column, Damien O'Meara recited the necessary quotes which lead the All-Ireland winner to issue a terse and fairly serious response.</p> <blockquote><p>Well, I imagine that makes sense to somebody but not much sense to me.</p></blockquote> <p>Presumably the next meeting between Brolly and Ó Sé will be a little frostier than the last.</p> <p>Picture credit: Brendan Moran / SPORTSFILE</p> <h5><strong><a href="http://www.balls.ie/gaa/joe-brolly-explains-why-tiernan-mccanns-ban-is-a-farce/304688">See also: Joe Brolly Explains Why Tiernan McCann's Ban Is A Farce</a></strong></h5> <h5><strong><a href="http://www.balls.ie/gaa/john-kavanagh-kerry-junior-footballers/304612">See also: Kerry Manager Reveals How John Kavanagh Helped Him Win An All-Ireland</a></strong></h5>
