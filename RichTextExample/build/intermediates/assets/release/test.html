Cursing, references to Guinness and barely legible accents. The three pillars of the stereotypical Irishman in the American consciousness. Now we could get on our uppity high horse about that or we could just watch these two Irish chaps on their J1 holiday in Texas and just enjoy it for the fun it is.

And before anyone says anything, the 'good day mate' is apparently a bit that the interviewer, Jim Knox, does whenever he interviews someone who's not American.
