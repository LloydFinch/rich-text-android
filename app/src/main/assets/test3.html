The extent to which Bill O'Herlihy is linked to the Irish sporting landscape is absolutely immeasurable. Perhaps we didn't truly appreciate that until the news broke that the great man has passed away at the age of 76. The cause of death has not yet been announced but it is understood that O'Herlihy passed away suddenly overnight having earlier attended the IFTA's in Dublin's Mansion house. Noel Curran, Director-General of RTÉ has released the following statement on behalf of the national broadcaster. <blockquote>Everyone in RTÉ is devastated at today’s news. Bill O’Herlihy was a giant of the sporting and broadcasting worlds in this country. His contribution to broadcasting was utterly unique. For decades he was at the centre of some of Ireland’s greatest sporting moments. He never hid his emotions on those big occasions, from disappointment to utter joy, and for this he was greatly loved. But he was also a fantastic broadcaster and interviewer, getting the very best out of his interview panels and provoking debate and insight, and for this he was also hugely admired. Our sincere sympathies go to Bill’s wife Hillary, daughters Jill and Sally, grandchildren, family, friends and colleagues.</blockquote> We would like to pass our condolences on to Bill's friends and family and as you can imagine, tributes have already begun to pour in. https://twitter.com/RTEsport/status/602794138464034816 https://twitter.com/darraghdoyle/status/602789950225022976 https://twitter.com/DietmarHamann/status/602797488198803456 https://twitter.com/RyleNugentRTE/status/602795625881726976 https://twitter.com/MiguelDelaney/status/602791454809923585 https://twitter.com/YouBoysInGreen/status/602792766066810880 https://twitter.com/sineadkissane/status/602796270739140608 https://twitter.com/nialloloughlin/status/602796020867670016 https://twitter.com/PatKennyNT/status/602794075532763138 https://twitter.com/Corktod/status/602798025438822400 https://twitter.com/FAIreland/status/602802813056475136 https://twitter.com/RTEArchives/status/602799285411979264 https://twitter.com/NickyByrne/status/602801973927256065 https://twitter.com/IrishRugby/status/602803041134387200 RIP Bill and thank you for a truly remarkable career.
