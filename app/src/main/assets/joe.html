Ignoring achievements</h3> You cleaned the coffee machine, got all your work done and helped out your colleagues in a tight spot, and not even an acknowledgement from the boss. Is it really that much trouble to just say "well done?" <img class="" src="http://media3.giphy.com/media/icSfwHwd8ykus/giphy.gif" alt="angry animated GIF " width="501" height="282" /> <h3>2. Not giving clear directions</h3> They wander past your desk warbling nonsensically and follow it up with a simple, "that alright with you?" You nod positively, because it's always good to be positive with the boss, but a slight panic wells inside you because you have no idea what was said or what has to be done. An email would have been better. <img class="" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/LgupB6K3n8AJW/giphy.gif" alt="justin timberlake animated GIF " width="440" height="440" /> <h3>3. No time for employees</h3> In a meeting, on the phone or leaving the office are probably the most common ways to contact your boss when you really need to talk to them about something and believe us, it can be frustrating. Does the only form of communication have to be an angry letter? <img src="http://media3.giphy.com/media/bAplZhiLAsNnG/giphy.gif" alt="working animated GIF " /> <h3>4. Not talking to subordinates</h3> This is a cheap one. Snubbing supervisors and workers is a head-melter and add a few more of these complaints and it won't be long before you have a very heated atmosphere in the workplace. Grrrrr. <img class="" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/tOMPmWrv4x53q/giphy.gif" alt="best animated GIF " width="555" height="408" /> <h3>5. Taking credit for other people's ideas</h3> We're surprised this isn't higher on the list. Taking credit for another person's work is an absolute killer. You genuinely can go on the Most Wanted list for this offence. Mid-way on the list is too low for this misdemeanor. <img src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/JO8y56O9mTmeY/giphy.gif" alt="angry animated GIF " /> <h3>6. No constructive criticism</h3> Having nothing good to say is never a good thing, and being positive is fundamental for the positivity of the entire workforce (See point 2) #positivity. <img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/aVOgaQLUVsHss/giphy.gif" alt="the office animated GIF " /> <h3>7. Not knowing people's names</h3> You've worked there for two years and the boss is still wandering past calling you someone else's name, it's just not a good look and it's really annoying. For the 347th time, my name is not Cornelius. <img class="" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/12MWTDpnzvFbSU/giphy.gif" alt="hello animated GIF " width="397" height="298" /> <h3>8. Refusing to talk in person</h3> Talking over the phone and conference calling are just not the same as talking in person. <img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/zxkG6MUFNuuas/giphy.gif" alt="sheldon cooper animated GIF " /> Things end up getting misconstrued and messy, and no one knows who's supposed to be doing what. So, our two week group holiday starts tomorrow, right? Right. <h3>9. Ignoring people's lives outside work</h3> Not realising the fact that you have a family and friends outside of work is a disaster. <img class="" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/PvoPbkvqPeFO0/giphy.gif" alt="matthew perry animated GIF " width="478" height="351" /> Expecting you to work late, at short notice, three nights in a row is also not acceptable. You have a life and things to do. For God's sake, has no one heard of Netflix? We don't know if we feel better or worse after this rant, but it's always good to vent, right? <em>Hat-tip to <a href="http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/these-are-the-most-annoying-things-about-your-boss--ZkDgP0ikzg" target="_blank">i100</a></em>",
