"<h3>Let's make it official.</h3> We might not have the heatwave we were expecting, but it's still really, bloody hot in many parts of Ireland today and not before time too if you don't mind us saying. A sunny day in Ireland is not complete with an ice cream to go with it and as if to prove that fact, HB revealed today that they <a href="http://www.joe.ie/life-style/an-unbelievable-number-of-ice-creams-are-expected-to-be-sold-in-ireland-during-the-heatwave/501817" target="_blank">expect to sell a quarter of a million ice creams</a> on every day there's hot weather, more than two ice creams per second. <a href="http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/30140055/icecreamgif.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-501842" src="http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/30140055/icecreamgif.gif" alt="icecreamgif" width="500" height="334" /></a> What we want to find out is the specific product that Irish people reach for when they go to the freezer. If they're not going for a 99 or feeling particularly hungry and opting for a big tub of Neapolitan ice cream, do they reach for a Brunch, a Cornetto, or a good old, solid Choc Ice? <a href="http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/30141808/salpaicecream.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-501845" src="http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/30141808/salpaicecream.jpg" alt="salpaicecream" width="319" height="431" /></a> With the help of HB and our ice cream-loving readers, we've put together a shortlist of ten ice creams (THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN IRELAND) particularly beloved by the Irish people and we want your help deciding which is the favourite. Cast your vote below and we'll be back with the results a little later on. In the meantime, we're off for that 99. <a href="http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/30135922/homerdroolgif.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-501840" src="http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/30135922/homerdroolgif.gif" alt="homerdroolgif" width="500" height="327" /></a> <script src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/8957459.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script> <noscript><a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/8957459/">What is Ireland's favourite ice cream?</a></noscript>"
