<h3>Some big decisions ahead...</h3> 
<p>While Jose Aldo may have called for a rematch with Conor McGregor following his 13 second defeat at the hands of the Irish man, it seems the UFC top brass don't see that on the horizon.</p>
<p>Director of Public Relations with the UFC Dave Sholler announced at the post-fight press conference that there's two possible scenarios facing Conor McGregor.</p>
<p>There have been rumours circulating about the difficulty Conor has in making the weight cut to 145 lbs,

<p>McGregor can either decide to stay at featherweight and put his title on the line against Frankie Edgar, who knocked out Chad Mendes last night.</p> 
<p>Or else he will vacate his belt, move up to lightweight and face the winner of Donald Cerrone and Rafael dos Anjos, who fight next weekend for the UFC lightweight belt.</p> <p>Although, McGregor has different ideas about vacating his featherweight belt...</p>
